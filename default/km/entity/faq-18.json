    "answer": "The draft lottery is comprised of the four teams that did not make the playoffs. Starting with the 2017 Draft, lottery odds are determined by taking into account the teamâ€™s two-year cumulative record.\n\n\n\nThe Lottery Team with the worst two-year cumulative record has 442 chances out of 1,000 to win the first pick, the Lottery Team with the second-worst two-year cumulative record has 276 chances out of 1,000, the Lottery Team with the third-worst two-year cumulative record has 178 chances out of 1,000, and the Lottery Team with the best two-year cumulative record having 104 chances out of 1,000 to win the first pick.  Tiebreakers are based solely on the immediately preceding season.",

This repository contains the Yext configuration resources for a fully built-out Sports Search demo using content from the WNBA, including the entity type schema, field schema, answers experience configuration, and the frontend site (using the frontend as a template repo). You can explore this respository to understand how the account is configured that powers this sample project, or you can apply these resources to an account. 

In order to apply the resources to your account, you will need to use the [Yext CLI](https://hitchhikers.yext.com/docs/cli/) or the Yext Admin Console ([production link](https://www.yext.com/adminconsole/resources?githubRepo=https://github.com/YextSolutions/sports-search-solution-sample-project) and [sandbox/playground link](https://sandbox.yext.com/adminconsole/resources?githubRepo=https://github.com/YextSolutions/sports-search-solution-sample-project)). *If you use the Admin Console, please make sure you are in the right environment for your account.*

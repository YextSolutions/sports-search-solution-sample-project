Chelsea Gray and Kelsey Plum scored 22 points each for Las Vegas, and A\u0027ja Wilson added 21 points and 10 rebounds. Shey Peddy made two of three free throws with 4.8 seconds left to give the Mercury an 86\\-84 lead, and Griner added one from the line to close the scoring. Griner also had a block on Wilson with 0.7 seconds remaining to secure the win.
